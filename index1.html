    <h2 style="text-align: left; margin: 15px 15px 15px 15px;" > Baba Ka Dhaba controversy: Blogger Gaurav Wasan refutes ‘fraud’ allegations</h2>
    <p> Food blogger Gaurav Wasan, of Swad Official, who had shot the heartrending viral video of a roadside Malviya Nagar eatery, Baba ka Dhaba, to show the plight of an elderly couple, who run the place, has been accused by YouTuber Lakshay Chaudhary of running an online scam. In a recent video uploaded Chaudhary, it is alleged that Wasan had sought donations on the pretext of helping the poor couple, but did not transfer the donation money to Kanta Prasad, owner of Baba ka Dhaba. Now, in an exclusive chat, Wasan tells us that these accusations are based on hearsay, and he has not done any “fraud”.

    <p>The ongoing electoral campaign in Bihar has seen three-term Chief Minister Nitish Kumar needing to remind his audiences about the alleged “jungle raj” of his predecessor Lalu Prasad Yadav. In a chapter for a forthcoming book titled Civility in Crisis: Democracy, Equality and the Majoritarian Challenge in India edited by Professors Suryakant Waghmore and Hugo Gorringe, I argue that Yadav’s rule has to be carefully examined for the feelings of dignity he evoked among the Bahujan majority in the state, who account for nearly 80% of its population.
